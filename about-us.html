    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <!-- Four sections of the About Us Page: Beginnings, Growth, Decline, and Today. Each have an outer div with the "hover_parent" class, the h2 with the name of the section, and a 
             correpsonding image (shows when div is not hovered on), and then an inner div with the "hover_hidden" class with a <p> tag which has text which is displayed on hover -->
            <div class= "hover_parent" id="Begin">
                <h2 class>Beginnings</h2>

                    <p>In 1892, brothers John and Amos Redfox invested the money their dead parents made selling cholera to the uninitiated into something they both had a passion 
                        for: steak. After decimating the local cow population, they pacified the angry locals by serving delicacies these dumb stupid idiot yeomen farmers had never
                            tasted in their short lifespans. We're talking SPICY BURGER SLIDERS, FILET MIGNON, SKIRT STEAK, MAC AND CHEESE, and so much more. This was the start of the
                            Redfox Steakhouse Empire.</p>

            <div class= "hover_parent" id="Growth">
                <h2>Growth</h2>

                <div class='hover_hidden'>
                    <p>Surviving the Great Depression by briefly substituting cow meat with car tires, Redfox benefitted from the wartime economic boom by selling their "meat" to 
                        the military, which has been quoted as being responsible for half of all casualties of the United States Armed Forces during the war. The post war period 
                        saw a return to using actual meat thanks to increased profits caused by housewives high on valium ordering the entire menu. The 50s were a time of growth 
                        as Redfox expanded it's scope to at it's peak 481 locations all across Dutchess County. With so much success, how could the line not keep on going up?</p>

            <div class= "hover_parent" id="Decline"> 
                <h2>Decline</h2>

                    <p>Like a Boeing 747 MAX, Redfox Steakhouse's profits took a plunge caused by the meddling of a little known governmental agency called the FDA, who didn't 
                        appreciate the finer mechanisms of the work we had done. Namely, it was the fact that we had never stopped using car tires that had done us in, and we were 
                        cooked no cap bussin skibidi rizz. We were forced to close most of our locations and scale back operations in 1971, which ended up devastating the local tire 
                        economy, which ended up further dooming us. It seemed that the wild highs of the past were finally over as John and Amos, now 124 and 123 respectively, were 
                        beaten to death at an FDA hearing for loudly mooing every time someone tried to say something.</p>

            <div class= "hover_parent" id="Today"> 
                <h2>Today</h2>
                <img src=images/AU_today_flag.png class="img_sizing">
                <div class='hover_hidden'>
                    <p>Today, we have only the one humble location, serving the same humble meals perfected by brothers Redfox 132 years ago, now having the maximum amount of tire 
                        we can include as regulated by the FDA. You selfish monsters have destroyed a beautiful legacy of fine dining and incredible taste, letting the FDA ravage us 
                        as you stood idly by, and all for what? It's a fact that 75% of all foods contain some sort of tire, do you really think that the FDA 
                        came down us with their "Hammer of Justice" because they were worried for the common good of the people? We have been persecuted, and those injustices cannot be forgiven. 
                        As long as blood still flows through our veins, us at Redfox Steakhouses will fight with any means neccessary to put our award winning resturaunt back in its rightplace place.
                        Anybody interested in joining our crusade against the FDA or donating to the GoFundMe to bail out John Redfox Junior on his vehicular manslaughter charge, give us a call or send
